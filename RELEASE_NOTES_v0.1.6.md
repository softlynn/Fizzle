# Fizzle v0.1.6

## Highlights
- Tray menu actions now reliably control live app behavior (`Enable/Bypass`, `Mute`, `Restart Audio`, and preset selection).
- Reduced visible gradient banding with subtle dithering in the app and tray surfaces.
- Settings overlay dimmer is now clipped to the rounded app body (no border overspill).
- Refined window control styling and hover/press feedback for a cleaner integrated header.
- Accent color treatment is now closer to the existing blue liquid-glass theme.

## Installer
- `Fizzle-Setup-0.1.6.exe`
