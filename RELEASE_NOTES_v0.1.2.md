# Fizzle v0.1.2

This update adds true auto-install updates, startup controls, and extra UI polish.

## Highlights
- Auto-update now auto-installs silently (not only download).
- New **Startup** tab in Settings with:
  - Start with Windows
  - Start minimized to tray
  - Open/close window with Program Auto-Enable
- Faster Settings overlay fade animation.
- Header/body integration polish for a more cohesive window.
- Window controls (min/max/close) have stronger hover/press feedback.
- Tray menu visuals are cleaner with rounded styling and improved readability.
- Updated README + website copy:
  - Discord/LIVE compatibility messaging
  - Auto-update behavior clarified as auto-install

## Notes
- Auto-install updates are applied via the installer in silent mode.
- For automatic update detection, keep **Settings → Updates → Auto-install new updates** enabled.
